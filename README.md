# Nodot Engine

## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**Nodot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of common tools, so that users can focus on making games 
without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click
to a number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows),
mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms and consoles.

## Free, open source and community-driven

Nodot is completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license.
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Nodot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the community not-for-profit.

Before being created its predecessor (Godot) fell under controversy after the managers
and moderators started getting political and ulimatly ruined the engine.
Nodot had been developed by Distorbed and the community (both still maintaining the project)
